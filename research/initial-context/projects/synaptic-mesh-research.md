**Status**: Early Development/Prototype Phase

## Core Vision
Synaptic Neural Mesh envisions transforming any device into an intelligent node in a globally distributed brain, creating a self-evolving, peer-to-peer neural fabric where every element is an agent.

## Architectural Foundations

### Distributed Neural Fabric
- **Core Principle**: Self-evolving, peer-to-peer neural fabric
- **Agent-Based**: Every element functions as an autonomous agent
- **Communication**: Learning and communicating across globally coordinated substrate
