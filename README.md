**Open-Swarm** is a distributed AI coordination system that transforms how developers access AI coding assistance. Built on the proven Claude-Flow foundation, Open-Swarm creates a community-owned network where developers contribute computing resources and receive unlimited, cost-effective AI assistance without vendor-imposed limitations.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Mission

**Vision**: Democratize AI coding assistance through distributed, community-owned networks that eliminate artificial scarcity and vendor lock-in.

**Mission**: Create an open-source alternative to centralized AI providers, delivering 60-80% cost reduction while maintaining enterprise-grade quality through hybrid orchestration of specialized small language models across consumer hardware.
