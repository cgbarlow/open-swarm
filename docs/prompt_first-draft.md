npx claude-flow@alpha swarm ‚Äúreview open-swarm/docs/initial-context_ai-code-chat_20250724.md and based on this, follow yolo WCP to create an overall epic for the project. The first GitHub issue features you will create that are linked to this epic are: 1. Problem statement, with linked .md with full detail. 2. Research, reviewing the initial-context document in detail, and doing deep-research into all of the provided references; your research will be saved beneath /open-swarm/research folder in suitable sub-directories. 3. A second research feature, this time exploring various technical approaches based on the research already conducted, and coming up with your recommendations based on the following criteria: re-use, simplicity, practicality, reliability, and functionality (meeting the brief). 4. A feature for the technical spec based on your best recommendation. 5. A feature for review of recommended next steps for the Agentics Foundation to move this project forward. 5. Create a suitable readme in root of open-swarm summarising everything. Ok. To sum up, I want you do dig deep on this one. Keep going and don‚Äôt stop until you have carried out ALL of the work in each of the features. First, create a swarm that simply does the write up of the GitHub issues for the Epic and all the Features discussed.  Next, working one feature at a time, create a swarm to get the job done, and then move to the next feature. Create a branch, do the work, create a PR, then merge - follow this pattern for each feature, then move onto the next feature. We are not delivering the code yet, we are still in the planning stages, but the planning will be comprehensive because we want to do this right, and do it once. This is your mission brief, carry out the brief to the best of your abilities. For the swarm!!! ü´°‚Äù
